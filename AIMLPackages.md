## NN-SVG

https://github.com/alexlenail/NN-SVG

NN-SVG is a tool for creating Neural Network (NN) architecture drawings parametrically rather than manually. 
It also provides the ability to export those drawings to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, suitable for inclusion in academic papers or web pages.
